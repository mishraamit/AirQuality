Predicting Air Quality Using Metal Oxide Chemical Sensor Data

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict air quality metrics (CO, Non-Methane Hydrocarbons, Benzene, NOx, NO2) based on data collected from metal oxide chemical sensors. The model will be trained on a publicly available dataset (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality) containing hourly readings from a sensor device deployed in a polluted Italian city over a year (March 2004 - February 2005).

Data Description:

The dataset consists of the following:

Sensor Responses: Hourly averaged responses from five metal oxide chemical sensors designed to detect specific air pollutants.
Ground Truth Concentrations: Hourly averaged concentrations of CO, Non-Methane Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) measured by a co-located reference analyzer. These are the target variables for prediction.
Time Information: Date and time of each data point.
Challenges:

Sensor Drift and Cross-Sensitivities: The sensors might exhibit drift over time and potentially respond to multiple pollutants, affecting the accuracy of their readings.
Missing Values: The dataset contains missing values that need to be addressed before modeling.
Data Exclusivity: This dataset is for research purposes only, and the results may not be directly applicable to commercial applications.
Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and potential outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the distribution of sensor responses and their relationship with actual pollutant concentrations.
Addressing Sensor Drift: Explore techniques to potentially mitigate the effects of sensor drift on model performance.
Feature Engineering: Investigate the creation of new features from existing data to improve model accuracy.
Model Development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models for predicting air quality metrics based on sensor responses. This could involve regression models to predict continuous concentration values.
Model Selection: Choose the best performing model based on evaluation metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.
Model Interpretation: Analyze how the model makes predictions and identify which sensor responses are most influential for predicting specific pollutants.
Success Criteria:

The success of this project will be measured by the following:

A well-performing machine learning model that can accurately predict air quality metrics based on sensor readings.
Development of techniques to address challenges like sensor drift and missing values.
A clear understanding of the limitations of the model due to sensor characteristics and data exclusivity.
By tackling these challenges, this project can contribute to the development of more robust air quality monitoring systems using metal oxide chemical sensors. It's important to remember that this research is for educational purposes and might not be suitable for real-world deployment without further validation and considerations.
